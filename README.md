# ProjectAlpha
ProjectAlpha is a team designed to develop a smart recycling bin.
We have named this product GreenCount.
The main aim of GreenCount is to collect information about what people are recycling and provide them with that data.
The prototype will use a Raspberry Pi, camera, motion sensor and cloud services.
